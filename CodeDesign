Software design

1- a python file to handle user input and output
2- a python file to handle writing and reading for database files
3- a python file to handle the logic of the program
4- a python file to handle the GUI (to be empty at first)
5- a python file to handle the cloud database (to be empty at first)

3- verify database file
4- create database file
5- delete database file
6- edit database file
7- display database file
8- search database file



3:
This file will be the main file of the program
It will use the other two files as modules

  a- call the welcome message function
  b- call the menu function
      A- see last workout
          1- call the read database function
